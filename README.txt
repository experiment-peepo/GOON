KEY CAPABILITIES
----------------
* Multi-Monitor Support: Assign different videos to specific screens or play across "All Monitors".
* Overlay Mode: High-performance transparent overlays that play directly on your desktop.
* Truly Portable: Stores all settings, logs, and sessions in a local 'Data' folder if write access is available.
* Web Integration: Stream directly from supported sites using integrated yt-dlp support.

QUICK START
-----------
1. Install the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime (linked above).
2. Extract the contents of this zip to a folder.
3. Run GOON.exe.
4. Drag and drop videos or paste URLs to get started.

KNOWN NOTES
-----------
* Lean Distribution: This version is "Framework-Dependent" to keep the file size small and the folder clean. It relies on your system's .NET 8 installation.
* Data Storage: If the app cannot create a local 'Data' folder (e.g., in a protected Program Files directory), it will fall back to %AppData%\GOON.
